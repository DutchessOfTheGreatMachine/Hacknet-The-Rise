    <posting title="Drifty car rental">Founded in 1958, Drifty is one of the most successful rental companies that provides vehicles for powersliding. The secret of Drifty’s succession lies in the nation-wide franchising network. The company offers a wide spectrum of car services — ranging from daily cars to jeeps, cabrios and trucks as well as multi-passenger cars and vans — any form of soon-to-be stoplight decoration for any taste of soon-to-be bloody garland. All of the “decorations” are outfitted with the top of the shelf equipment, including: accelerometer, hydraulic handbrake, adjustable coilovers and sway bars, and other things for sideways sidewalk climbing. Flexible management of car fleet makes Drifty interesting not only for parking lot demons, but also for serial stoplight decorators as well as professional drivers.
