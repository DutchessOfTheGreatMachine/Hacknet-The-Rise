        <body>Awesome result. They’re getting busy from what I hear. 

In the meantime, I’m looking into some dirt digging. Thus, I’ll need you to run some ePhone forensics. Check the proxy, I’ve uploaded some tools there.

Our little suspect is Kim Burnaby. Ex-Pacific Air IT specialist. Was directly involved with the whole thing with the asians. I need some info on his current whereabouts, and I’d rather have an outsider on him, rather than bothering our employees with this less than legal private life intrusion.

And just like last time, I’m ready to triple your standard rate on this. Hope it’s enough to sell the idea for you.

Start looking from his laptop. There’s bound to be something related to Pacific Air. Likely an IP to some internal server. No need to hack in, I just need a pressure point for conversation.

Los Geht’s!
