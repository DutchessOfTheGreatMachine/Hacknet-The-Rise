        <body>Greetings,

My company once again needs some outside specialist to do some… covert work, I’ve issued a new check in your name, miss Wikstrom.

We’ve been eyeing up expansion into the American market for a long time, now we have a perfect opportunity for it. A certain Psylance Cyber Security is on the brink of bankruptcy after a total failure in fulfilling their obligations to some big contractor from some asian corp.
Thus we need someone to take a peek in their work routines, to see if we can scrap more than just a shell company for American expansion.

Currently your task is simple. I need to check if you still can do wonders. 

I’ve dedicated a proxy for you. Hack in, snatch all the tools I left for you. Reply when done. Out.

Maximilian Gottschall,
Assistant DigiSec Director, Norex GmbH
